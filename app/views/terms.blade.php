			<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Terms of service of Oboli</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				The following terms of service apply to the provision of the services 
				of Oboli (the “Services”) through the registration of users in our 
				website willing to use the Services provided in it. 
				The Services allow the users  - by the mean of collecting 
				Obolis ( a virtual currency) -  to support NGOs they choose 
				around the world.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>The relationship between the User and Oboli</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				The use by the user of the products, software, services, 
				websites or mobile Apps of Oboli (collectively defined as 
				the ‘Services’ in the present document with the exception of 
				any service delivered by Oboli under a separate written agreement) 
				is subject to the following terms that the user accepts’. “Oboli” 
				refers to Oboli Ltd, V.A.T. number 9212915, 
				located in 114-115 Tottenham Court Road - Midford Place - London - W1T 5AH, 
				in the person of its 
				sole administrator and legal representative, Mr. Davide Mauriello. 
				Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Oboli, the relationship 
				between the User and Oboli will be governed by and construed 
				in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in this 
				document. The regulation of the relationships 
				between Oboli and the User may also include supplementary 
				terms of service that will be promptly brought to the attention 
				of the User (the ‘Terms’).
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Acceptance of the Terms</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				To benefit from the Services, the User must previously agree to the Terms.
				If the User doesn’t agree to the Terms, he will not be entitled to use the Services.
				It is possibile to accept the Terms: 
				a) by clicking on the option that grants 
				the acceptation of the terms, where this option is made available  
				by Oboli in the user interface for any Service; or 
				b) by actually using the Services; 
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Language of the Terms</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Where Oboli has provided a translation of the Terms in a different 
				language than the English one, then the User 
				agrees that the translation is provided for his
				 convenience only and that the English language versions 
				 of the Terms will govern his relationship with Oboli, 
				 and if there is any contradiction between the English version 
				 of the Terms and the versions in other languages, 
				 the English version will take precedence and prevail.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Specifications</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				For the purposes of this contract, the terms “Registration Mode” 
				shall have the meaning set by the following definition: 
				“Registration Mode: The use of Services by the user customizing 
				his guest profile by adding in the custom settings of his profile a 
				custom nickname. For this purpose,  the user will be able to use the 
				main window of Oboli in order to run the registration process of his 
				own profile on the Oboli platform (i.e. website and /or App)  by 
				inserting his own data necessary and qualifiable as non-sensitive data, 
				below indicated: a) email b) nickname c)password d) age e) gender.

				a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, 
				which are provided by another person or company.

			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				Here below you can find the privacy policy for oboli.co.in and for 
				services provided through our website and Oboli Mobile applications 
				("our sites") by Oboli Limited.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Our principles</strong>
				<br />
				<br />								
				1 We do our best to protect your privacy by using security technology appropriately. Indeed:
				• we make sure that we use appropriate security measures to protect your information; and
				• we make sure that when we cooperate with an other organisation providing  services for us, they have appropriate security measures.
				2 We will respect your privacy. You should receive marketing emails only from us and, if you agree, from other organisations we have carefully chosen. We will make sure it is clear when you can make these choices, for example, we have boxes you need to tick if you want to receive marketing. However, we may email you occasionally with information or questions about your registration, your subscription account or postings, for example, with reminders, warnings or copyright requests.
				3. We will collect and use individual user details only if we have your permission or we have sensible business reasons for doing so, such as collecting enough information to manage subscriptions.
				4 We will be clear in our dealings with you as to what information about you we will collect and how we will use it.
				5 We will use personal information only for the purposes for which it was originally collected and we will make sure we delete it securely.
				6 If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be done with the relevant protection (stated under UK law) being in place.
				What kind of data we collect.
				We collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons: 
				1. To provide personalised services to individual registered users. 
				2. To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer and make them more accurate.
				3. To sell advertising space on the site.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>How we use your information</strong>
				<br />
				<br />									
				This privacy notice tells you what to expect when the we collect personal information. 
				It applies to information we collect about:
				visitors to our websites and/or our Mobile App
				complainants and other individuals in relation to the services we provide
				people who use our services, eg who subscribe to our newsletter or request a publication from us
				job applicants 
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>
				<br />
				<br />									
				We collect information on you: 
				 when you register or become a member of our website or of our Mobile App (the sites)
				when you use the sites
				 through cookies
				 if you choose to reveal information in postings. 
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Registration</strong>
				<br />
				<br />									
				Registration is needed to use our services. The minimum information we need to register is your name, email address and a password. We will ask you more questions for different services.
				We may also ask some other, voluntary questions during registration for certain services (for example, professional networks) so we can obtain a clearer understanding of who you are. This also allows us to personalise services for you.
				After you have registered, we may send you emails we think may interest you, if you agree. At any time you can decide not to receive these emails and will be able to 'unsubscribe'.
				Who we share data with
				We will not share your personal information with others for marketing purposes unless you have given us your permission. If we have your permission, we will share your information only with other organisations we have chosen carefully. 
				We may make other organisations' services available, through our sites, although we are not necessarily operating these sites. We process any information which we collect when you access a service provided by another organisation under this privacy policy. Information these other organisations collect is governed by their own privacy policies.
				We can access and release personal information to keep to relevant laws and government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both us and our users. 
				Some of our webpages use plug-ins from other organisations, such as “Facebook”. These other organisations may use information about your visit to our websites on their pages. If you browse these pages while still also logged in to your account with us, information they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use information, please read their privacy policies.
